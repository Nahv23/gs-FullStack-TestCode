  ```
   cd gs-api
  ```
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;_Run the following command:_

  ```
  
For the Front Web App, the same:

  &nbsp;&nbsp;_Enter the gs-front directory inside the gs-fullstack-testCode one:_
  ```
   cd gs-front
  ```
  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;_And run the following command:_
  ```
  docker build -t gs-app-front .
