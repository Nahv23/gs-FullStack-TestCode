  ```
   _cd gs-api_

  ```
  Run the following command
  ```
  _docker build -t gs-app-back ._

For the Front Web App, the same:

  Enter the gs-front directory inside the gs-fullstack-testCode one
  ```
   _cd gs-front_

After created both images just write the command to launch the Docker Compose

  _docker-compose up_


Then you are able to reach both application in each route
  
  For API http://localhost:3001/ 

  For Web App (connected to the API) http://localhost:3000/
