## Docker ðŸ“¦

First, check if both Docker images exist. If they do not exist follow these steps to create the Docker images for each part and run both with the Docker Compose to run them at the same time:

For the REST API:

  _Enter the gs-api directory inside the gs-fullstack-testCode one:_
  ```
   cd gs-api
  ```
  
  _Run the following command:_
  ```
   docker build -t gs-app-back .
  ```
  
For the Front Web App, the same:

  _Enter the gs-front directory inside the gs-fullstack-testCode one:_
  ```
   cd gs-front
  ```
  
  _And run the following command:_
  ```
  docker build -t gs-app-front .
  ```
  
After created both images just write the command to launch the Docker Compose:
  ```
    docker-compose up
  ```

Then you are able to reach both application in each route.
  
  For API http://localhost:3001/ 

  For Web App (connected to the API) http://localhost:3000/
